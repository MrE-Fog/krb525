.SH DESCRIPTION
.I krb525_check_conf
check a
.Ikrb525d(8)
configuration file. Given a mapping it will read the given configuration
file and report wether or not the mapping would be allowed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIclient\fP
specifies the client principal name to be simulated as the
original client principal in the ticket to be converted.
By default this is the default principal of the current credentials cache.
.TP
\fB\-C\fP \fItarget_client\fP
specifies the target client to be used in the test.
By default this is the same as the original client name (if a target
service is specified) or the username of the user running the
process (if no target service is specified).
.TP
\fB\-h\fP \fIhostname\fP
specifes the host that should be simulated as the originating host
for the request.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP \fIinput_cache\fP
specifies the cache to use for getting the default client name.
By default it will be the current user's default cache.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP \fIrequesting client\fP
specified the client principal name to be used as the client who
requested the conversion. This is usually the same as the client
that is the ticket to be converted, but not always. By default
this is the client in the ticket.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fIservice\fP
specifies the service principal name to be simulated as the original
service principal for the request.
By default the service will be the Kerberos ticket-granting-ticket
service for the local realm.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP \fItarget_service\fP
specifies the target serivce to be used in the test.
By default the service will be unchanged and this will be the same as
.IR service
unless no target serivce and client were specified in which case this
will be the Kerberos ticket-granting-ticket service for the local realm.
.TP
.TP
.B \-v
specifies that
.I krb525_conf_check
should run in verbose mode. This can be handy for debugging.
.TP
.B \-V
specifies that
.I krb525_conf_check
should print it's version number and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
This example shows
.I krb5_check_conf
being used to see if mary@FOO.BAR could change the client in her ticket for
krbtgt/FOO.BAR@FOO.BAR to jane@FOO.BAR with the request coming from
somehow.foo.bar

.nf
%./krb525_check_conf -c mary@FOO.BAR -s krbtgt/FOO.BAR@FOO.BAR -C jane@FOO.BAR -v -h somehost.foo.bar test.conf
Initializing Kerberos
Parsing client name mary@FOO.BAR
Client name is mary@FOO.BAR
Parsing service name krbtgt/FOO.BAR@FOO.BAR
No target server speicied, useing original: krbtgt/FOO.BAR@FOO.BAR
Reading configuration from test.conf
Checking configuration for:
    mary@FOO.BAR for krbtgt/FOO.BAR@FOO.BAR
      converting to
    jane@FOO.BAR for krbtgt/FOO.BAR@FOO.BAR
      from somehost.foo.bar
SUCCESS
.fi

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.I krb525_check_conf
uses the following environment variable:
.TP "\w'.SM KRB5CCNAME\ \ 'u"
.SM KRB5CCNAME
Location of the default credentials (ticket) cache.
.SH FILES
.TP "\w'/tmp/krb5cc_[uid]\ \ 'u"
/tmp/krb5cc_[uid]
default credentials cache ([uid] is the decimal UID of the user).
.SH SEE ALSO
krb525.conf(5), krb525d(8), kinit(1)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 if the conversion would have succeeded, 1 if it
would have failed, or 2 if some other error occurred.
