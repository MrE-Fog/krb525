	* srv_conf.c (init_conf): Added checking for version in
	configuration file

	* parse_conf.c (free_pconf_enteries): Fixed bug that caused
	segfault when free_pconf_enteries() was called.

	* Makefile.in: Added build of krb525_check_conf

	* krb525_check_conf.1: Added this file

	* server.c: progname was not getting set correctly. Use progname
	in call to setup_auth_context() to be consistant with client.

	* client.c: progname was not getting set correctly. Fixed bug in
	call to setup_auth_context() that caused failures with clients with
	instances in their names. 

	* auth_con.c (setup_auth_context): Use sin_port and not sin_addr
	in call to krb5_gen_portaddr(). This keeps us from having cache
	conflicts when krb525 and krb525d are running on the same machine.

	* client.c (get_creds_with_keytab, get_creds_with_ccache): 
	Added options to passed arguments. Changed callers.
	Code will not make tickets from keytab forwardable.
